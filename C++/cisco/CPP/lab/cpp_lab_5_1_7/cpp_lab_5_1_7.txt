5.1.7.1 Binary searching

Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

binary search - sorting;
binary search - searching.
Scenario
Write a program that creates a vector of countries with names and areas in thousands of square km (we've prepared a list of ten of the biggest countries in the code). Next, ask the user for the area to find, try to find this area, and print "Found." when it is found, and "Not found." otherwise. Remember to sort the vector before searching.

Your version of the program must print the same result as the expected output.

Example input
9992

Example output
Not found.

Example input
2780

Example output
Found.

Example input
9984

Example output
Found.


#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

struct Country
{
	string name;
	int area;
};

//your code

int main()
{
	vector <Country> countries = {
		{"India", 3287 },{ "Argentina", 2780 },
		{"Brazil", 8515}, {"Australia", 7692},
		{"China", 9572 },{ "United States of America", 9525 },
		{"Russia", 17098 },{ "Canada", 9984 },
		{"Kazakhstan", 	2724 }, {"Algeria", 2381 } 
	};

	//your code

	return 0;
}
