6.1.7.1 Set-related operations

Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

set-related operations - finding max;
set-related operations - finding min;
set-related operations - operating on objects.
Scenario
We'll use the data from the previous task to find the biggest and the smallest countries from both datasets. Your program should display:

name and area of the smallest country from the first vector;
name and area of the smallest country from the second vector;
name and area of the biggest country from the first vector;
name and area of the biggest country from the second vector.
Your version of the program must print the same result as the expected output.

Algeria 2381
Algeria 2381
Russia 17098
Brazil 8515


#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <functional>

using namespace std;

struct Country
{
	string name;
	int area;
};

//your code

int main()
{
	vector <Country> countries = {
		{ "India", 3287 },{ "Argentina", 2780 },
		{ "Brazil", 8515 },{ "Australia", 7692 },
		{ "China", 9572 },{ "United States of America", 9525 },
		{ "Russia", 17098 },{ "Canada", 9984 },
		{ "Kazakhstan", 	2724 },{ "Algeria", 2381 }
	};

	vector <Country> countries_small = {
		{ "Brazil", 8515 },{ "Australia", 7692 },
		{ "Kazakhstan", 	2724 },{ "Algeria", 2381 }
	};

	//your code
	
	return 0;
}
