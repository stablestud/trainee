4.1.10.1 Rotating operations

Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

rotate - using the function
Scenario
Pay attention to the values in the given vectors. Use only the rotate function (once or more) to manipulate the second vector to be equal to the first.

Your version of the program must print the same result as the expected output.

You did it.


#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
	vector<int> values = { 8, 1, 5, 6, 7 };
	vector<int> rotated = {5, 6, 7, 8, 1};

	//your code

	if (rotated== values)
		cout << "You did it." << endl;
	else
		cout << "Try again." << endl;

	return 0;
}
