Lab 5.3.9 Points in 2D: part 2
Objectives
Familiarize the student with:
modelling real-world entities with classes and objects;
interactions between objects of the same type;
creating objects based on objects of other objects of custom classes.

Scenario
A line in two-dimensional space can be represented by two parameters, the slope and the y-intercept.
If we represent the slope as a and the y-intercept as b, then all points that belong to that line can be expressed by the equation y = ax +
b.
Knowing two points that belong to a line, we are able to calculate the slope and the y-intercept of the line.
Your program should read two sets of x and y coordinates and construct an object of the class Line2D, based on those two points.
Output the line in the form "y = [slope]x [+-] [y_intercept]

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class Point2D{
public:
Point2D(double x, double y);
string toString();
// ...
private:
double x;
double y;
};
class Line2D{
public:
Line2D(double slope, double y_intercept);
Line2D(Point2D pointA, Point2D pointB);
string toString();
// ...
private:
double slope;
double y_intercept;
};
// implement Point2D and Line2D methods
