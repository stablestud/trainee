5.1.6.1 Finding equal ranges

Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

equal ranges - finding them;
equal ranges - distinguishing between the beginning and the end of the range.
Scenario
Write a program that creates one vector of size 9 (fill the vector with the values: 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7). Next, your program should print the values from the first value of 3 to the second value of 6 (separate the values with spaces).

Your version of the program must print the same result as the expected output.

3 3 4 5 6 6


#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
	//your code

	return 0;
}
