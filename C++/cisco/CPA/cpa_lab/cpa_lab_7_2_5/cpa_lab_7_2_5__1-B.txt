Lab 7.2.1 Exceptions: simple checks
Objectives
Familiarize the student with:
throwing exceptions;
handling exceptions.

Scenario
Write a simple class for a matrix algebra with basic operations (methods in this class) which allow the programs to:
create a matrix object with specific dimensions;
fill the matrix with values;
add values to the matrix;
add a matrix to the matrix.
When one of the matrix parameters is empty (also in the add a value method) or the added matrices don't fit one another, you must
throw an exception. In the main function: create three testing matrices, two with the same size and one with another size. Try to
compute the sum of all the matrix pairs, add some try-catch blocks and an appropriate message. Print the results on the screen. What
other cases should be tested?

Example input
2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3

Example output
0 0
0 0
Matrices don't fit.
Matrices don't fit.
