/*
 *** Lab 3.4.2 One step further: finding the lengths of months ***
 ** Objectives **
 *
 * Familiarize the student with:
 * - building a set of cooperating functions,
 * - singnalling erroneous arguments using a specific return value.
 *
 ** Scenario **
 *
 * Let's continue our coder's reflections on time. Now, when you have a reliable function diagnosing the nature of any year, you can use it
 * to implement another important function returning the length of any month (measured in days, of course).
 *
 * Write a function equipped with the following features:
 * - its name is "monthLength"
 * - it accepts two arguments of type int: year number (first) and month number (second)
 * - it returns an int value which represents a length of specified month in a specified year (obviously, year is important only when
 * month == 2) or 0 if any of the input arguments isn't valid
 * - it should be mute
 *
 * We've prepared a skeleton of the program - fill the function body with an appropriate content!
 *
 * We've also attached the output that is expected from your program.
 *
 * Hint: there are at least two ways of implementing the function: you can use switch or (something which seems a bit smarter) declare a
 * vector storing months' lengths â€“ choose the more convenient style.
 *
