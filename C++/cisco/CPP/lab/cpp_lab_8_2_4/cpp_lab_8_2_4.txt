8.2.4.1 Using files - flags

Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

file - opening it with ifstream;
file - using flags to check the status.
Scenario
Write a program that reads a file from the disk and prints only the even lines from this file. You should use the ifstream class and getline function, and also remember to check the appropriate flags. If your program can't open the file, display the message: "File error: couldn't open."

Remember to create a text file with the content as in the second example input.

Your version of the program must print the same result as the expected output.

Example input
No file.

Example output
File error: couldn't open.

Example input
File content: ASDF asdf QWER qwer

Example output
asdf qwer


#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <string>
#include <iomanip>

using namespace std;

int main() {
	string filename  = "filename.txt";

	//your code

	return 0;
}
