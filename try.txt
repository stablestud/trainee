Competitive programming
Copying constructors that initializes variables like a subconstructer (e.g
Class ( src &x ) : variables ( x ) {}
Pointers to constants - can it only be not modified through the pointer? e.g. try to bypass the limitation
Constructor void : localVar ( value );
Can I create a class only with a copy constructor?
Copying constructor ( class* source ) - pointer instead of reference ( call with function passed by value! )
Composed class copying everything? Even with all implicitly constructors
Const return value of functions / const pointer parameter
GetChar(); - does it only work on Windows?
Can all methods have an semicolon?
Initiate value in class with same name as superclass
Const class field initialize with different data tye
