C++ INSTITUTE - PROGRAM YOUR FUTURE

Lab 5.3.12 Inheritance basics: part 2
Objectives
Familiarize the student with:
inheritance syntax and operation;
sharing functionality between objects using inheritance.

Scenario
Let's continue with our farm example from the previous lab.
Create classes representing cows, sheep and horses:
a sheep will consume about 1.1 liters of water per day per 10 kg of weight;
a horse will consume about 6.8 liters of water per day per 100 kg of weight;
a cow will consume about 8.6 liters of water per day per 100 kg of weight.
Your program should read lines of text in the following form: "[animal] [weigth]".
When your program encounters an empty line, it should print the total water consumption and exit.
