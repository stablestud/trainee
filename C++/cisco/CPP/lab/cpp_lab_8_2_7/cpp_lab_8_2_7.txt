8.2.7.1 Writing files

Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

reading files - using ifstream;
writing files - using ofstream;
writing files - data modification.
Scenario
Write a program that copies a file and appends a line number (starting from 1) and colon to the start of each line. You should use the ifstream and ofstream classes and the getline function.

If your program can't write to or read from the file (e.g., you haven't got access, you have an improper path), display the message: "File error: couldn't open."

After the copy operation, read the created file and print the first three lines of it. Remember to create the file with input.

Your version of the program must print the same result as the expected output.

File content:
ASDF
asdf
QWER
qwer

1:ASDF
2:asdf
