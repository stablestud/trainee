3.1.8.1 Mismatch operations

Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

mismatch - using the function;
mismatch - preparing data.
Scenario
You have two series of given numbers (in the code below). Try to find mismatches (with the use of the mismatch function) in this data, assuming that a mismatch is when two values differ by more than a certain value (starting at value 15). Try to find mismatches until there are no more mismatches. Display (as in the output shown) the actual values, and the values from both vectors, adding 1 in each iteration.

Your version of the program must print the same result as the expected output.

First difference greater than 15 is found: 211 - 227
First difference greater than 16 is found: 302 - 320
First difference greater than 17 is found: 302 - 320
First difference greater than 18 is found: 229 - 210
First difference greater than 19 is found: 260 - 239
First difference greater than 20 is found: 260 - 239
First difference greater than 21 is found: 311 - 333

	vector<int> noisy_values =
		{ 211, 324, 203, 113, 227, 320, 340, 210, 239, 411, 412, 333, 371, 501 };

	return 0;
