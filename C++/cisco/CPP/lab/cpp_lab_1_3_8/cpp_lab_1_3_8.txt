1.3.8.1 Iterators - over-collection

Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

iterators - creating them;
vectors - filling them with values;
vectors - the copy constructor;
printing on screen.
Scenario
Write a program that creates two vectors and asks the user for the number max_value. If max_value is odd, then increment it by one. Next, your program should fill the vectors with positive values smaller than max_value, by filling the first vector with odd values and the second vector with even values.

After this, create two loops: the first (external) loop iterates over the elements of the first vector, while the second loop (internal) iterates over the elements of the second vector. Display the result of adding the elements inside the inner loop, separated by spaces, and after the inside loop, print a newline.

Then, create two new loops, both of them backward loops. In this case, you must use suitable iterators. Display the result of adding the elements in the same way as before. The results of this part should be in reverse order relative to the first one.

Your version of the program must print the same result as the expected output for all given input. Test it for all input cases, and think also about corner cases (i.e., for an input of zero, the program must produce empty output).
