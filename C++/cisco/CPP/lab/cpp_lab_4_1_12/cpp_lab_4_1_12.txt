4.1.12.1 Partitioning operations

Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

partitioning - creating separate parts;
partitioning - predicate writing.
Scenario
Write a program that fills a vector with numbers from 1 to 40. Next, divide it into two parts, the first part consisting of numbers divisible by 3 (without the remainder) and numbers with the digit 3 in them, and the second part consisting of every other number.

Display these two sequences of numbers on separate lines (separate numbers with spaces). You don't have to create any variables to hold the separate parts, just display them.

Your version of the program must print the same result as the expected output.

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

//your code

int main()
{
	vector<int> results(40);

	//your code

	return 0;
}
