4.1.8.1 Unique operations

Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

unique - creating a new vector;
unique - using the function with objects.
Scenario
Write a program that creates a vector filled with pets' names and their types (we've already created it for you), then create a second vector and copy only the pets with unique names from the first vector to the second.

Pets are the objects of a class with two values: name and pet_type. Pets are unique only when they have different names. Write the content of both vectors, each pet on one line, with one newline after the first vector.

Your version of the program must print the same result as the expected output.

Amber Cat
Barky Dog
Barky Reptile
Casper Fish
Casper Reptile
Godzilla Reptile

Amber Cat
Barky Dog
Casper Fish
Godzilla Reptile


#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

//your code

int main() 
{
	vector<Pet> pets = { {"Amber", "Cat"}, {"Barky", "Dog"}, { "Barky", "Reptile" }, 
		{"Casper", "Fish"}, {"Casper", "Reptile"}, {"Godzilla", "Reptile" } };

	vector<Pet> uniquePets(pets.size());

	//your code

	return 0;
}
