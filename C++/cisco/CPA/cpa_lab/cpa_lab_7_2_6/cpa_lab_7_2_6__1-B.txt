Lab 7.2.1 Exceptions: simple checks
Objectives
Familiarize the student with:
situations when exceptions are thrown;
throwing exceptions;
handling exceptions.

Scenario
Write a very simple class to hold one value and its boundaries (limits of the value in integer numbers), add one method to add a value to
the one held in the instance of class, and one method to subtract a value from the one held in the object. In both methods, throw an
 xception when a value exceeds the limits. In the main function create two objects and test them with different scenarios. Print the
values held at the end of the program. Add adequate try-catch blocks and an appropriate message.

Example input
5 0 10
9 0 100
15
15
90

Example output
Value could exceed limit.
Value could exceed limit.
