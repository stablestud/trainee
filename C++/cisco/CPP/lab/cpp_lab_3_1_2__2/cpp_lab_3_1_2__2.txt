3.1.2.2 for_each - part II

Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

lists - creating them;
lists - filling them with values;
lists - removing and inserting values;
printing on screen.
Scenario
Write a program that creates a vector with values 3, 5, 6, 8, and 9. After this, print the squares of all the vector elements, and after a newline, print all the elements in reverse order. Your version of the program must print the same result as the expected output. Try to keep your program short - remember to use for_each.
