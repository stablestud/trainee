8.1.22.1 Using streams - getline

Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

getline - simple usage;
string - finding a string in string.
Scenario
Write a program that takes one line from the user (store it in a string variable). Next, your program should check if the input starts with the exact introduction: "My name is ", then take the rest of the string and display the message: "Hi, rest_of_string!".

If the input doesn't start with the correct string (case-sensitive), display the message: "Hi, please introduce yourself."

Your version of the program must print the same result as the expected output for all given input. Test it for all input cases.

Example input
My name is Sarah

Example output
Hi, Sarah!

Example input
My name is John

Example output
Hi, John!

Example input
Myrname ys noname

Example output
Hi, please introduce yourself.


#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
	string introduction = "My name is ";

	//your code

	return 0;
}
