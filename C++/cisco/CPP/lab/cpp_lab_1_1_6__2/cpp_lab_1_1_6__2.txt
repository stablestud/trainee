1.1.6.2 Vectors - filling them with values - part II

Objectives

Familiarize the student with:

    vectors - creating them;
    vectors - filling them with values;
    printing on screen.

Scenario

Write a program that takes one floating-point number and creates a vector with five float values:

    given number;
    given number + 5;
    given number + 0.5;
    given number + 2.3;
    given number + 4.7.

After this, print the sum of the vector elements and the average value (sum/vector size). Your version of the program must print the same result as the expected output. Try to keep your program short.

Example input
1

Example output
sum: 17.5 avg: 3.5

Example input
1.2

Example output
sum: 18.5 avg: 3.7

#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

using namespcace std;
int main()
{
	vector<float> v(5);
	//your code
	return 0;
}
