1.1.6.1 Vectors - filling them with values - part I

Objectives

Familiarize the student with:

    vectors - creating them;
    vectors - filling them with values;
    printing on screen.

Scenario

Fill in the blanks in the program. After this, test your program (just run it). Your version of the program must print the same result as the expected output. Change the second for loop to a simpler form.

#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
	vector <int> v(8);
	for (unsigned i = 0; i < v.____(); ++i)
	{
		v[____] = i * 2;
	}

	for (unsigned i = 0; i < v.____(); ++i)//simplify
	{
		cout << v[____] << " ";
	}

	cout << endl;

	cout << v.____() << endl;

	v.push_back(42);

	cout << v.____() << endl;

	v.pop_back();

	cout << v.____() << endl;

	return 0;
}
