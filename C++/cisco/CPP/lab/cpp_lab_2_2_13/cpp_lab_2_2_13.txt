2.2.13.1 Sets - counting and searching

Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

sets - creating them;
sets - counting elements of a specific value;
sets - finding elements of a specific value;
sets - iterating over them;
printing on screen.
Scenario
Write a program that creates two sets (the sets are given in the code below) and asks the user for a number. Next, your program should count how many times the given number appears in both sets. If it is not found, then display: "Not found", but if it is found (count>0), then display all the elements from the found element to the end of the set, separated with spaces. Create a function to do all of these operations with the set and the number, and call it twice (for both sets). Your version of the program must print the same result as the expected output for all given input. Test it for all input cases.

Example input
2.71

Example output
2.71 -1.1 -2.3 2.71 2.19 -3.14 -3.88

Example input
2.19

Example output
Not found 2.19 -3.14 -3.88

Example input
3.14

Example output
Not found Not found


#include <iostream>
#include <set>
#include <functional>

using namespace std;

//your code

int main() {
	set <double, greater<double>> valuesA = { -1.1, 2.9, -2.3, 2.71 };
	set <double, greater<double>> valuesB = { -3.14, 2.71, -3.88, 2.19 };

	double value;

	cin >> value;

	//your code

	return 0;
}
