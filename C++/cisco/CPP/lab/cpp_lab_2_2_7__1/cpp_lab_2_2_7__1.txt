2.2.7.1 Sets - iterators

Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

sets - creating them;
sets - filling them with values;
sets - iterating over them;
printing on screen.
Scenario
Write a program that creates two sets and asks the user for two numbers: start_value and stop_value. Next, your program should fill the sets with positive values, starting from start_value and stoping at stop_value, by filling the first set with odd values and the second set with even values, then filling the first set with even values and the second set with odd values. After this, create two loops: the first (external) loop iterates over the elements of the first set, while the second loop (internal) iterates over the elements of the second set. Display the result of adding the elements inside the inner loop, separated by spaces, and after the inside loop, print a newline. Remember that set values are sorted.

After this, create a new loop, which loops backward over both sets. In this case, you must use suitable iterators. Display the result of adding adequate elements in the same way as before. After this, create a copy of the last loop (with the code inside it) and change the declaration of the iterators to auto (leave everything else the same) - it must display the same results.

Your version of the program must print the same result as the expected output for all given input. Test it for all input cases.

Example input
1 3

Example output
2 3 4 3 4 5 4 5 6 6 4 2 6 4 2

Example input
3 7

Example output
6 7 8 9 10 7 8 9 10 11 8 9 10 11 12 9 10 11 12 13 10 11 12 13 14 14 12 10 8 6 14 12 10 8 6

Example input
4 9

Example output
8 9 10 11 12 13 9 10 11 12 13 14 10 11 12 13 14 15 11 12 13 14 15 16 12 13 14 15 16 17 13 14 15 16 17 18 18 16 14 12 10 8 18 16 14 12 10 8
