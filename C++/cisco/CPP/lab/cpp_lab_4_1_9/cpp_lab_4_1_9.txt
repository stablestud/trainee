4.1.9.1 Reversing operations

Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

reverse_copy - using the function.
Scenario
Write a program that checks if a sequence of given numbers is a palindrome of some other numbers (the sequence is given in the code below).

A palindrome is a sequence of numbers which reads the same backward as forward.

First, get five numbers from the user, then create a reversed copy of this sequence, then check it for equality with the given values. If it's equal, print "Palindrome." Otherwise print "Not palindrome."

Think about this: do you have to keep the original values of both sequences in all cases?

Your version of the program must print the same result as the expected output.

Example input
8 7 6 5 1

Example output
Palindrome.

Example input
1 2 3 4 5

Example output
Not palindrome


#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int main() 
{
	vector<int> values = { 1, 5, 6, 7, 8 };

	//your code

	return 0;
}
