Public and private in struct, initializers (e.g constructors), virtual, this ->
Competitive programming
Copying constructors that initializes variables like a subconstructer (e.g
Class ( src &x ) : variables ( x ) {}
Pointers to constants - can it only be not modified through the pointer? e.g. try to bypass the limitation
Constructor void : localVar ( value );
Can I create a class only with a copy constructor?
Copying constructor ( class* source ) - pointer instead of reference ( call with function passed by value! )
Composed class copying everything? Even with all implicitly constructors
Const return value of functions / const pointer parameter
GetChar(); - does it only work on Windows?
Can all methods jave an semicolon?
Initiate value in class with same name as superclass
Const class field initialize with different data tye
static <-> friend / also must static be declared as public?
GLobal Scope operator :: only to global variables or to the highest one? e.g. created in main()
Can a catch re-throw the exception?
