5.1.5.1 Finding boundaries

Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

finding boundaries;
lower_bound - using it;
upper_bound - using it.
Scenario
Write a program that creates one vector of values from 1 to 20 in ascending order. Find the lower bound of 5 and the upper bound of 11 and print all the values between, including the bounds.

Your version of the program must print the same result as the expected output.
