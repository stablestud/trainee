7.1.3.1 Comparison operators

Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

comparison operators - using them;
comparison operators - using them in transform;
printing on screen.
Scenario
Write a program that finds relations between two given vectors (look at the code below) and stores binary values in three vectors (one for storing values equal in both given vectors, another for values less than in the first vector, and the last for values greater than in the first vector).

You should use transform with functional operators to compute the result values. After this, print all the vectors.

Your version of the program must print the same result as the expected output.

3 4 5 4 4 5 3 4
3 3 2 1 5 6 9 4
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0


#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iterator>
#include <functional>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

//your code

int main()
{
	vector<int> v1 = { 3, 4, 5, 4, 4, 5, 3, 4 };
	vector<int> v2 = { 3, 3, 2, 1, 5, 6, 9, 4 };
	vector<int> resultsEqual(v1.size());
	vector<int> resultsLess(v1.size());
	vector<int> resultsGreater(v1.size());

	//your code

	return 0;
}
