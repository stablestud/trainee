8.1.4.1 Using cout

Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

cout - using it;
cout - using it inside loops;
printing on screen.
Scenario
Write a program that creates a string (as in the code below) and asks the user for two numbers: start_value and stop_value. Next, your program should print (with cout, of course) the characters from the given string (beginning at start_value and ending at stop_value), separated by spaces.

If start_value is greater than stop_value, then display the message: "Stop value must be greater than or equal to start value."

If either start_value or stop_value is greater than 42, then display the message: "Stop value and start value must be less than or equal to 42."

Your version of the program must print the same result as the expected output for all given input. Test it for all input cases.

Example input
4 15

Example output
q u i c k b r o w n

Example input
0 11

Example output
T h e q u i c k b r

Example input
15 18

Example output
f o x


#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
	string s= "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog";

	//your code

	cout << endl;

	return 0;
}
