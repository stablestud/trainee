3.1.7.1 Counting operations

Objectives

Familiarize the student with:

    count_if - using the function;
    count_if - using the function with a predicate.

Scenario

Write a program that creates one vector of double numbers (the values are given in the code below), and asks the user for two numbers: start_value and stop_value.

After this, print how many elements are in the given range (you don't have to check the correctness of the range - if the user inputs incorrect values, then he or she just finds zero elements).

Your version of the program must print the same result as the expected output for all given input. Test it for all input cases.

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

using namespace std;

//your code

int main()
{
	vector<double> values = 
		{ 2.1, 3.14, 2.2, 1.1, 2.11, 3.2, 3.6, 2.5, 2.6, 4.11, 4.12, 3.11, 3.73, 4.83};

	unsigned start_value;
	cin >> start_value;

	unsigned stop_value;
	cin >> stop_value;

	//your code

	return 0;
}
